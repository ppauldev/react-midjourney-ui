# React AI - Case study with Midjourney, ChatGPT and AI image upscaler

This is a landing page website for an imaginary upcoming React AI-powered component creation service. The website was created using a combination of UX/UI design generated by [Midjourney AI](https://www.midjourney.com/), [AI image upscaler](https://www.upscale.media/), Photoshop and text generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

## UX/UI Design

The UX/UI design for the landing page was created using the Midjourney AI platform.
The following prompt was used:

> "a landing page which shows a waiting list call-to-action for a new software startup which sells chatgpt-build products with a minimalistic color theme using the latest ux ui design trends of 2023"

The following image was one of the results of the above prompt and was used as the starting point for the next steps.

Post-processing was done with the AI image upscaler and Adobe Photoshop.

## Text Content

The text content for the landing page was generated using ChatGPT. The introduction, headline, and call-to-action were all generated by ChatGPT with the prompt:

> "Write a headline, introduction and call to action for a landing page which has the goal to subscribe to an email waiting list for a product that creates React components with the help of AI"
